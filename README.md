        Typosquatting: If a URL is intentionally designed to look like a trusted website (e.g., "g0ogle.com" instead of "google.com"), the bot flags it.

        URL Shorteners: Links from services like Bit.ly or TinyURL can mask malicious destinations‚ÄîPhishing Authority spots them and raises a red flag.

        Entropy Check: Unusual, random strings in a domain name? Phishing Authority can catch them and assess the risk.
